## 0.18.1

- `DateTime.isSameLocalWeekAs()` now uses default localization's week start if `weekStart` is omitted. Closes #11

## 0.18.0

- `differenceInDays` no longer forces local timezone
- Added `date` getter, returns Date with hours, minutes, etc set to 0.
- Added new constructor: `DateTimeConstructors.dateWithTimezone`

- Documentation work has begun.
  - See [docs](https://dev.gege.mn/moment_dart_docs)
  - See [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/sadespresso/moment_dart_docs)

## 0.17.4

## 0.16.0

> This release has breaking changes!

- `Duration().toDurationString()` first argument is now **named**, and ***optional***. When null, uses global localization set using `Moment.setGlobalLocalization(MomentLocalization)`
- Now `weekStart` of `DateTime().startOfLocalWeek([int weekStart])` is nullable, and defaults to `Moment.defaultLocalization.weekStart`
- Now `weekStart` of `DateTime().endOfLocalWeek([int weekStart])` is nullable, and defaults to `Moment.defaultLocalization.weekStart`

## 0.15.0

- Now it's possible to set global localization with `Moment.setGlobalLocalization(MomentLocalization)`
- Renamed `Moment.localization` to `Moment._localization`, making it private, and nullable. However, this shouldn't be breaking change as `Moment.localization` getter is introduced. Getter returns instances' localization, or global localization in case the instance doesn't have set localization

## 0.14.0

> This release has breaking changes!

- [BREAKING] moment.format("YY") now **no longer throws exception** when year doesn't fall in range (1970, 2030). Instead, it returns full year. e.g., `DateTime(1969).format("YY"); // 1969`
- [BREAKING] moment.format("gg") now **no longer throws exception** when ISO week year doesn't fall in range (1970, 2030). Instead, it returns full year. e.g., `DateTime(1969).format("gg"); // 1969`
- [BREAKING] `DateTime.format(...)` now expect named arguments instead of optional positional arguments

## 0.13.0

> This release has breaking changes!

- [BREAKING] `endOf_()` and `startOf_()` now *preserves* the timezone instead of always returning local `DateTime` object

## 0.12.0

- [BREAKING] Renamed `MomentLocalizations.deDE()` to `.de()`
- [BREAKING] Removed `Moment().elapsed()` for sake of `Moment().fromPrecise()`
- [BREAKING] Now `startOf_()` and `endOf_()` no longer converts to local timezone. It just "assumes" it is in local timezone.
- All localizations are now lazy-loaded Singletons

## 0.11.0

- Calendar no longer includes time when the date is too distant (distant that it's formatted with 'l' token)

## 0.10.5

- Fixed am/pm suffixes for `mn_Mong_MN` and `mn_Qaaq_MN`

## 0.10.3

- Added `.format()` and other functions as extension on `DateTime` objects
- `.format()` now takes another optional argument `forceLocal`, to convert the DateTime before formatting.

## 0.10.2

## 0.10.1

- Fixed duration suffix in `mn_MN`, `mn_Mong_MN`, `mn_Qaaq_MN`

## 0.10.0

- Introduced concept of `UnitString`, a wrapper class for unit translations. For example, UnitString for minute may look like "19 minutes", "19 min", "19m" depending on the `UnitStringForm` (full, mid, short respectively)
  - `Moment.from(...)` and `Moment.fromNow(...)` now takes `form` argument, which can alter the output. Defaults to `UnitStringForm.full`
- Introduced `Moment.fromPrecise(...)`, `Moment.fromNowPrecise(...)`, `Moment.duration(...)` for more precise durations
- German (de_DE) relative duration now shows correct forms when prefixes/suffixes are omitted
- Removed deprecated functions
